# Digit Classifier Project

## Description
This project is a simple digit recognition application that uses a machine learning model to predict handwritten digits (0-9) based on an 8x8 pixel sketch. The model is trained using the scikit-learn library on the Digits dataset and deployed with a Gradio interface for easy interaction.

## Features
- Predicts handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
- Uses a Logistic Regression model trained on 8x8 pixel images.
- Provides a user-friendly interface via Gradio.
- Locally runnable with Python.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
